Rather than a static list of phone numbers, the ""Contact Support"" flow is an interactive sequence. It first attempts to resolve the student's intent using Knowledge Base articles, FAQs, or direct links to service pages. If self-resolution fails, the system presents the specific communication channels (Enquiry Form, Phone, Booking, Walk-in) relevant to that specific topic and the student’s current profile status.

1. Contextual Entry Points
The ""Get Help"" flow can be initiated from a global ""Help & Support"" centre.

Contextual ""Need Help?"" links appear on specific functional pages (e.g., an ""Enrolment Support"" link on the Study Plan page).

Contextual links pre-select the triage category based on the page the user is currently viewing to reduce friction.

2. Topic Triage & Intelligent Deflection
Upon initiating the flow, the user is prompted to select a category/topic (if not already pre-selected) or describe their issue (keyword search).

Before showing contact details, the system displays a ""Recommended for you"" section containing:

Relevant knowledge base articles (e.g., ""How to apply for an extension"").

Direct links to self-solve transaction pages (e.g., ""Apply for Special Consideration"" form).

The user must interact with a ""Did this solve your issue?"" or ""I still need help"" mechanism to proceed to contact channels.

3. Dynamic Channel Presentation
Once the user confirms they still require assistance, the system displays only the contact channels valid for that specific inquiry type:

Submit Enquiry: Opens the specific web form for that topic (eg. integrated with Salesforce Case Management).

Phone: Displays the specific support line number and current opening hours.

Appointments: Displays a ""Book Appointment"" button if the service offers consultations (e.g., Course Planning).

Walk-in: Displays physical location (Stop 1) and current queue/wait times if available.

4. Enquiry Capture & Handoff
If ""Submit Enquiry"" is selected, the form pre-fills known student data (Name, ID, Course).

The subject/topic selected during triage is automatically applied to the case to ensure correct routing to backend teams.
